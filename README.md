# Nonlinear Dynamics

The repository contains code for experimenting with non-linear dynamical systems in Python. The code is based on the book [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](https://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering) by Steven Strogatz.
